\section{Questions with Answers}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item At what pressures do the incompressible, inviscid, thermally non-conductive Euler Equations work in?
		
		\item To apply Godunov's method on a system of equations we need only determine $ q^\downarrow(q_l, q_r)$, the state along $ x/t = 0 $ based on the Riemann data $ q_l $ and $ q_r $. What does this mean?
	\end{itemize}
